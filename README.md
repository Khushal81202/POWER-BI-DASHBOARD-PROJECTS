🛠️ Technologies Used  

🔹 PostgreSQL  
PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) used for storing and managing transactional data. It was utilized for:  
- Data Extraction & Transformation – Writing SQL queries to filter, aggregate, and join datasets.  
- Complex Analysis – Performing calculations like total revenue, transaction counts, and interest earned.  
- Optimized Queries– Using indexes and partitions to improve query performance for large datasets.  

🔹 Business Intelligence (BI) Tools – Power BI  
Power BI was used to build interactive dashboards with:  
- Data Modeling – Connecting PostgreSQL data and creating relationships between tables.  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Writing calculated measures for deeper insights.  
- Visualizations – Creating bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and slicers for interactive filtering.  
- Drill-Through Reports – Enabling detailed analysis by clicking on visual elements.
